- Browser simulation
- Password testers
- Network diagrams
- Terminal interfaces

### 3. Instant Feedback
- Green/red validation
- Explains why answer is right/wrong
- Guides to correct solution

### 4. Progressive Difficulty
- School labs (S001-S010): Basic concepts
- Institution labs (I001-I010): Advanced scenarios

## Current Status

**Fully Implemented (3/20):**
- ✅ S001 - Phishing Website Detection
- ✅ S002 - Suspicious Email Recognition  
- ✅ S003 - Password Strength Evaluation

**Ready to Implement (17/20):**
- S004-S010: Social media, device security, scams, malware, cyberbullying, apps, gaming
- I001-I010: Advanced attacks, ransomware, SQL injection, brute force, insider threats, etc.

## How It Works

### Example: Email Lab (S002)

**Step 1 - Sender Analysis:**
```
Student sees: support@paypa1.com
Student types: "The 1 should be an L - it's fake"
System validates: Checks for keywords (paypa1, fake, wrong, 0)
Result: ✓ Correct! or ✗ Try again
```

**Step 2 - Urgent Language:**
```
Student selects checkboxes:
☑ URGENT ACTION REQUIRED
☑ CLOSED IMMEDIATELY  
☑ within 24 hours
☑ Click here NOW

System validates: Must select 3+ to pass
Result: ✓ All pressure tactics identified
```

### Example: Password Lab (S003)

**Step 2 - Create Strong Password:**
```
Student types: MyP@ssw0rd2024!

Live validation shows:
✓ 12+ characters
✓ Uppercase
✓ Lowercase
✓ Numbers
✓ Symbols

Strength meter: 100% (Green)
Result: ✓ Excellent password!
```
